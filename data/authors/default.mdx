Welcome to my blog! I'm a passionate Computer Science student with a 
focus on Data Engineering at the University of São Paulo, São Carlos. 

I started my academic journey in the Mechanical Engineering course at UFSCar (~~which I dropped out~~), 
so I decided to do Computer Engineering (~~I dropped out too~~), now I am currently pursuing 
a Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science with a specialization in Data Engineering.

I am proficient in a variety of programming languages, including Python, SQL, ~~Java, and 
Javascript~~. My expertise extends to technologies like Pandas/Polars, PySpark, Terraform, 
and web development tools like React and Node. Additionally, I am well-versed in database 
management systems such as PostgreSQL and MongoDB, and have hands-on experience with cloud 
computing platforms like GCP and AWS.

I have had the privilege of interning as a Data Engineer at Petlove, where I contributed 
to data warehouse modeling on GCP and developed data pipelines using Python, Spark/SparkSQL, 
and Airflow. At Caju, my role as a Data Analyst involved designing SQL-driven solutions, 
creating reports and predictive models with Python, and implementing customer base clustering 
algorithms to improve business metrics.
